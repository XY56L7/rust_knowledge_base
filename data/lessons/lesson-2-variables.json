  "content": "# Variables and Immutability\n\nIn Rust, variables are **immutable** (unchangeable) by default. This means that a variable's value cannot be modified unless we explicitly mark it with the `mut` keyword.\n\n## Basic Syntax\n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;        // immutable variable\nlet mut y = 10;   // mutable (changeable) variable\n```\n\n## Why Immutable by Default?\n\nThis design decision provides several advantages:\n- **Safety**: Reduces the possibility of accidental modifications\n- **Concurrent Programming**: Easier to write safe code\n- **Readability**: Clear which variables can be modified\n\n## Shadowing\n\nRust allows **shadowing**, when we create a new variable with the same name:\n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\nlet x = x + 1;  // new variable, not modification\n```\n\nThis is different from `mut`, because it creates a completely new variable.",
