  "content": "# Blockchain Fundamentals\n\nA **blockchain** is a distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in a secure and verifiable way.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Decentralization\n\nUnlike traditional databases controlled by a single entity, blockchains are distributed across many nodes (computers). Each node maintains a copy of the entire blockchain.\n\n### Immutability\n\nOnce data is written to a blockchain, it cannot be altered. This is achieved through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms.\n\n### Transparency\n\nAll transactions are visible to all participants, while maintaining privacy through cryptographic techniques.\n\n## Blockchain Structure\n\n```rust\n// A blockchain is a chain of blocks\nstruct Blockchain {\n    blocks: Vec<Block>,\n}\n\n// Each block contains transactions\nstruct Block {\n    index: u64,\n    timestamp: u64,\n    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,\n    previous_hash: String,\n    hash: String,\n}\n```\n\n## Key Properties\n\n1. **Distributed**: No single point of failure\n2. **Immutable**: Historical data cannot be changed\n3. **Transparent**: All transactions are visible\n4. **Secure**: Cryptography ensures integrity\n5. **Consensus**: Agreement on valid transactions\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital money (Bitcoin, Ethereum)\n- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts\n- **Supply Chain**: Tracking goods from origin to consumer\n- **Identity Management**: Decentralized identity systems\n- **Voting Systems**: Transparent and verifiable elections\n\n## Why Rust?\n\nRust's memory safety and performance make it ideal for:\n- Validating transactions quickly\n- Securing cryptographic operations\n- Handling concurrent consensus mechanisms\n- Building reliable node software",
