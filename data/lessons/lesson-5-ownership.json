  "content": "# Ownership\n\n**Ownership** is one of Rust's most important and unique features. This system guarantees memory safety without using a garbage collector.\n\n## Principles\n\n1. **Every value has one \"owner\"**\n2. **There can only be one owner at a time**\n3. **When the owner goes out of scope, the value is freed**\n\n## Scope and Ownership\n\n```rust\n{  // s doesn't exist here\n    let s = String::from(\"hello\");  // s is valid from here\n    // use s\n}  // s goes out of scope, memory is freed\n```\n\n## Move Semantics\n\n```rust\nlet s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\nlet s2 = s1;  // s1's value moves to s2\n// s1 is no longer usable!\nprintln!(\"{}\", s1);  // ERROR!\n```\n\n## Copy Types\n\nSome types are automatically copied (Copy trait):\n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\nlet y = x;  // x's value is copied, not moved\nprintln!(\"{}\", x);  // OK, x is still usable\n```\n\nCopy types: integers, bool, char, tuples (if all elements are Copy).",
